\title{Expand Model}
\usage{
mp_expand(model)

mp_reduce(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A model object.}
}
\description{
Expand a structured model so that it is represented in an unstructured
format requiring a more verbose description. Currently,
this is only applicable for \code{\link{mp_tmb_model_spec}} objects
that have explicit flows
(e.g. \code{\link{mp_per_capita_flow}}). For such models, \code{mp_expand}
produces a model with expression lists composed entirely of plain R
formulas.

Reduce a model by removing any model structure
(e.g. \code{\link{mp_per_capita_flow}}), so that expression lists
are plain R formulas.
