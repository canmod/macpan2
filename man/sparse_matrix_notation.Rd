\title{Extract Sparse Matrix Notation from a Dense Matrix}
\usage{
sparse_matrix_notation(M, zero_based = TRUE, tol = 1e-04)
}
\arguments{
\item{M}{A numeric matrix or object coercible to a matrix.}

\item{zero_based}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), the returned row and column
indices are zero-based (starting at 0). If \code{FALSE}, indices are one-based
(as in standard R matrices).}

\item{tol}{Numeric tolerance (default \code{1e-4}). Entries with absolute value
less than or equal to \code{tol} are treated as zero.}
}
\value{
A named list with components:
\describe{
\item{\code{row_index}}{Integer vector of row indices for non-zero entries
(adjusted by \code{zero_based}).}
\item{\code{col_index}}{Integer vector of column indices for non-zero entries
(adjusted by \code{zero_based}).}
\item{\code{values}}{Numeric vector of the non-zero entries.}
\item{\code{M}}{The original input matrix, coerced to a dense matrix.}
\item{\code{Msparse}}{A copy of \code{M} with near-zero entries (as determined by
\code{tol}) replaced by exact zeros.}
}
}
\description{
Converts a dense matrix to a sparse representation by extracting its non-zero
entries and their indices. Entries with absolute value less than or equal to
\code{tol} are treated as zeros.

\examples{
M <- matrix(c(5, 0, 0,
              0, 0, 3,
              0, 2, 0), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
sparse_matrix_notation(M)
