\arguments{
\item{spec}{A model specification made with \code{\link{mp_tmb_model_spec}}
or related function.}

\item{sort_paths}{Should the paths/rows be sorted to minimize the
number times an edge must go through a node that it is not connected with?}

\item{combine_columns}{Should each state/node get its own column in the
layout (\code{FALSE}) or should the algorithm try to place branching states
in the same column (\code{TRUE}, default).}

\item{deduplicate_edges}{Should each row have all of the edges in the path
or should duplicate edges be removed?}

\item{loops}{Regular expression for matching the names of flows that cause
loops in the flow model, and so should be ignored when building the layout.}

\item{ignore}{Regular expression for matching the names of flows that should
be removed from the layout analysis entirely. These will be isolated in
a data frame for custom drawing of 'difficult' edges.}

\item{x_gap}{Size of the gap to the left and right of the 1-by-1 space
provided for a node.}

\item{y_gap}{Size of the gap above and below the 1-by-1 space
provided for a node.}

\item{north_south_sep}{Horizontal separation between north and south
flow arrows.}

\item{east_west_sep}{Vertical separation between east and west flow arrows.}

\item{trim_states}{List of states to remove from the diagram}
}
\description{
Layout the flow diagram of a model specification so that each row is
one of the paths through the model (ignoring loops).
