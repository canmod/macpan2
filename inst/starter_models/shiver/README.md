This model builds on the basic SEIR model, with two additional compartments for vaccination and hospitalizations. 

Vaccines are typically subject to resource constraints and distribution strategies might prioritize vaccinations for specific subpopulations, such as immunocompromised people, to reduce bad outcomes. We model this with a flow of susceptibles entering the vaccination class. Following vaccination, most individuals return to the susceptible class when the acquired immune response wears off, called *vaccine waning*.

In reality, vaccinations are only partly effective in developing a protective host immune response. This *vaccine failure* includes both vaccine-related inadequacies and host-related reasons like health status and genetic factors (Wiedermann et al., 2016). Vaccine failure is modelled as flow from vaccination to the exposed class.

The SHIVER model assumes all individuals can be exposed to the disease, but transmission rates depend on vaccination status. Additionally, individuals with severe infections are hospitalized and assumed to be isolated, before recovering from the disease. Hospital isolation means this portion of infectious individuals no longer contribute to the transmission dynamics. 

# States

| variable | description                        |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| S        | Number of susceptible individuals  |
| H        | Number of hospitalized individuals |
| I        | Number of infectious individuals   |
| V        | Number of vaccinated individuals   |
| E        | Number of exposed individuals      |
| R        | Number of recovered individuals    |

The size of the total population is,  $N = S + H + I  + V + E + R$, and the disease spreads through homogenous mixing of the subpopulation $N_{\text{mix}}=N -H$.

# Dynamics 

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dS}{dt} &= -\beta_{S} S\frac{I}{N_{\text{mix}}} - \phi S + \rho V\\
\frac{dV}{dt} &=  \phi S - \rho V - \beta_{V} V\frac{I}{N_{\text{mix}}} \\
\frac{dE}{dt} &= (\beta_{S} S + \beta_{V} V) \frac{I}{N_{\text{mix}}} - \alpha E \\
\frac{dI}{dt} &= \alpha E - \gamma_I I - \sigma I\\
\frac{dH}{dt} &= \sigma I- \gamma_H H \\
\frac{dR}{dt} &= \gamma_I I + \gamma_H H
\end{align*}
$$

This model could be optionally parameterized with $\beta_{S} = \beta$, and $\beta_{V} = a \beta$ with $a \in (0, 1)$ to explicitly show that the rate at which vaccinated individuals acquire infection and transmit the disease is reduced when compared to unvaccinated individuals (Brauer & Castillo-Chavez, 2012).
