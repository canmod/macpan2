Looking more at odin-monty.  

This design philosophy is different from the one I have in mind for macpan2 :  https://mrc-ide.github.io/odin-monty/slides/fitting.html#/design-philosophy 



This roadmap is focused on things I donâ€™t understand and things I do understand that are about computational efficiency  https://mrc-ide.github.io/odin-monty/slides/fitting.html#/roadmap 

* Update on the Plague project
* Dev work
  * Quiet pkg check
  * Document adding of engine functions in CONTRIBUTING.md, with some simplification
  * New engine functions: `invlogit`, `logit`, `sin`, `sqrt`
  * pkgdown (nicer formatting on pkgdown topic titles, Fix rendering of math equations)
  * Complete engine function documentation
  * Using `mp_state_vars`/`mp_flow_vars` more consistently
  * Documented how assignment works (i.e., functions on the left hand side)
* GUI fun
* Differences between us and odin2: 
  * state space model and MCMC is the generic approach
  * design philosophy is provide modular pieces with 'minimal handholding'
* Summer workshop
* Roadmap
  * Vector valued FOI
  * Log linear model of time variation
  * Distribution specification documentation and hierarchical and binomial
  *
