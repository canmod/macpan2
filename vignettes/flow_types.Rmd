## Types of Flows
The `Macpan2` library allows for six different types of flows. They are:

1. `per_capita` 
2. `absolute`
3. `per_capita_inflow`
4. `per_capita_outflow`
5. `absolute_inflow`
6. `absolute_outflow`

There is also a demo model with one flow of each type.

```{R}
flow_example_dir = system.file("starter_models", "flow_examples", package = "macpan2")
flow_example = Compartmental(flow_example_dir)
flow_example$labels$state()
flow_example$labels$flow()
flow_example$flows()
```

Modelers can specify the type of a given flow in the `type` column of the `flows.csv` file.

## per_capita Flows

Probably the most common type of flow `per_capita` flows move a given proportion of the population in the `from` compartment to the `to` compartment. For example if two compartments `A` and `B` have populations `P_a` and `P_b` respectively and are linked by a per_capita flow with flow rate `r` then the population of `A` will decrease by `P_a * r` per unite time and the population of `B` will increase by an equal amount. So after a single time step the population of `A` will be `P_a - P_a * r` and the population of `B` will be `P_b + P_a * r`.

## Absolute Flows

Unlike per_capita flows, absolute flows specify the change in compartmental populations in absolute terms. If compartments `A` and `B` are connected by an absolute flow with rate `r` then the population of `A` will decrease by `r` per unite time and the population of `B` will increase by an equal amount. Thus after a single time step the population of `A` will be `P_a - r` and the population of `B` will be `P_b + r`.

## Inflows and Outflows

Flows can also be specified as `inflows` or ` outflows`. Inflows increase the population of their `to` compartment but have no effect on the population of their `from` compartment. Similarly outflows decrease the population of their `from` compartment but do not have any `to` compartment. Inflows and outflows can be either `per_capita` flows or `absolute` flows. For example if `A` is a compartment with an `absolute_outflow` and a flow rate `r` then after a single time step `A` will have a population of `P_a -r`. Since outflows have no `to` compartment the population that is removed from `A` is not added anywhere, the total population of the model will decrease by `r`. Alternatively, if `B` is a compartment with a `per_capita_inflow` with rate `r` and `from` compartment `A` then the population of `B` will increase by `P_a * r` per unite time. Notably, the population of `A` will not be changed so the total population of the model will increase. After a single time step the population of `B` will be `P_b + P_a * r` and the population of `A` will be `P_a` (baring the influence of any other flows `A` might have).

## Specific Example

We have created an example model which includes each type of flow. One key detail is that Macpan2 currently requires all flows in the `flows.csv` file to have both an `from` and `to` compartment. [See here](https://github.com/canmod/macpan2/issues/56). This includes for `absolute_inflows` which have no `from` compartment as well as `absolute_outflows` and `per_capita_outflows` which have no `to` compartments. In this example we have explicitly used a dummy compartment to fulfill the requirement, in principle any compartment can be used as a dummy compartment since no actual changes to that compartments population will result from being used in this way. Note that `per_capita_inflows` do require a `from` compartment as the population of that compartment will be use to compute the total inflow to the `to` compartment. As with the other one-sided flows though `per_capita_inflows` do not change the population of their `from` compartment.

``` {R sim_values}
 flow_simulator = flow_example$simulators$tmb(
   time_steps = 10,
   state = c(A = 1000, B = 0, C = 0, D = 0, Dummy = 0),
   flow = c(absin = 1000, absout = 500, abs = 100, percap = 0.5, percapout = 0.25, percapin=0.25)
 )
```

 Because this model includes absolute flows it is important to chose starting values carefully to prevent state populations from going below zero.

```{R run_sims}
 flow_results = flow_simulator$report()
 head(flow_results, 16)
```
