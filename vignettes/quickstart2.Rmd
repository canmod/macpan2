This article is the counterpart to `vignette('quickstart', package = 'macpan2')`, but instead of explaining the spec and sim of a simple SIR, we describe the **new** components introduced by trying to specify a product model. While the new "productify" functionality should make most of the content of this article obsolete eventually, this article can serve as a resource for users until then.
