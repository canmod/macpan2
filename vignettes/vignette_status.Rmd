We use a status system in `macpan2` to communicate the maturity of each article to users.

## Stable

![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-stable-green)

Please read!

## Mature Draft

![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-mature%20draft-yellow)

Should be consistent and accurate, but not yet widely utilized and/or checked for correctness.

## Working Draft

![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-working%20draft-red)

Makes some sense, but could very well be inconsistent or confusing.

## Stub 

![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-stub-red)

Do not even bother reading.
