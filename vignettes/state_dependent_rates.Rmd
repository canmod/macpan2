Choose one susceptible and one infectious candidate from the population.

* S-candidate is susceptible, $S_S$
* S-candidate is in age group, $S_{A_i}$
* S-candidate is in immunity status, $S_{V_j}$
* I-candidate is infectious, $I_I$
* I-candidate is in age group, $I_{A_i}$
* I-candidate is in immunity status, $I_{V_j}$

We only consider $\text{pr}(S_S) = 1$.

We let $q_{jk} = \text{Pr}(I_{V_j} | S_{V_k})$



In most compartmental models, flow rates depend not only on the compartments directly involved in the flow but also on other compartments. A typical example is infection: the rate at which individuals move from a susceptible compartment to an exposed compartment depends on the number of infectious individuals. We frame this setup generically, with \( S \) representing the source (“from”) compartments, \( E \) the destination (“to”) compartments, and \( I \) a set of other compartments whose states influence the flow. While infection is the motivating example, this structure also captures processes like vaccination, where uptake rates depend on vaccine supply, or treatment initiation, where rates depend on healthcare capacity.  

We define
$$
S = (S_1, \ldots, S_n)^\top, \quad E = (E_1, \ldots, E_q)^\top, \quad I = (I_1, \ldots, I_m)^\top,
$$
where each element represents the number of individuals in a specific stratum (e.g., by age, location, symptom status, or immunity level). The stratifications of \( S \), \( E \), and \( I \) may differ. For example, \( S \) and \( E \) might be stratified by age alone, while \( I \) is stratified jointly by age and symptom severity. As a result, \( n \), \( q \), and \( m \) are generally distinct. In special cases—such as omitting a latent period—one may simplify by setting \( E = I \).

---

### Force of Infection and Flow Allocation  

The **force of infection** is given by
$$
\Lambda = \beta I,
$$
where \( \beta \) is an \( n \times m \) transmission matrix with entries \( \beta_{ij} \) representing the per-capita contribution of infectious individuals in stratum \( j \) to the infection risk of susceptibles in stratum \( i \).  

The vector of outflows from \( S \), denoted \( F^{\text{out}} \), is
$$
F^{\text{out}} = \Lambda \circ S,
$$
where \( \circ \) denotes elementwise multiplication. The vector \( F^{\text{out}} \) has length \( n \), matching \( S \).  

To account for different stratifications of \( S \) and \( E \), we define an **allocation matrix** \( M \) of size \( q \times n \), where \( M_{ki} \) is the proportion of individuals leaving \( S_i \) who enter \( E_k \). The inflow into \( E \), denoted \( F^{\text{in}} \), is given by
$$
F^{\text{in}} = M F^{\text{out}}.
$$
Here, \( F^{\text{in}} \) is a length-\( q \) vector matching \( E \). This is standard matrix multiplication: each entry of \( F^{\text{in}} \) is a weighted sum of the outflows from \( S \), with weights given by \( M \). By construction, the total flow is conserved:
$$
\sum_{k=1}^q F^{\text{in}}_k = \sum_{i=1}^n F^{\text{out}}_i.
$$

---

### Stratified Transmission and Multiplicative Decomposition  

When compartments are stratified, heterogeneity in susceptibility, contact patterns, and infectivity can be captured by factorizing the transmission matrix \( \beta \). We write:
$$
\beta = \operatorname{diag}(\sigma) \, P \, \operatorname{diag}(\tau),
$$
where:  
- \( \sigma \) is a length‑\( n \) vector of *susceptibilities* for each \( S \) stratum,  
- \( P \) is an \( n \times m \) *contact matrix* describing contact rates between \( S \) and \( I \) strata,  
- \( \tau \) is a length‑\( m \) vector of *infectivities* for each \( I \) stratum.  

The **force of infection** is then
$$
\Lambda = \beta I,
$$
and the absolute outflow from each \( S \) compartment is
$$
F^{\text{out}} = \Lambda \circ S.
$$

This decomposition emphasizes how susceptibility, contact rates, and infectivity combine multiplicatively to determine transmission dynamics across strata.

---

### Relation to the Standard SI Model  

In a standard unstratified SI model, there is a single susceptible compartment \( S \) and a single infectious compartment \( I \), with total population \( N = S + I \). The force of infection is typically written as
$$
\Lambda = \beta \frac{I}{N},
$$
so the rate at which susceptibles become infected is \( \Lambda \cdot S = \beta \frac{I}{N} \cdot S \).  

In terms of our general framework:
- \( n = q = m = 1 \),  
- \( \sigma = 1 \),  
- \( P = 1 \),  
- \( \tau = \beta / N \),  

so that
$$
\beta = \sigma \cdot P \cdot \tau = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{\beta}{N} = \frac{\beta}{N}.
$$

The outflow from \( S \) is
$$
F^{\text{out}} = \Lambda \cdot S = \frac{\beta}{N} \cdot I \cdot S,
$$
matching the standard mass-action incidence.  

Thus, the classical SI model corresponds to the special case where there is no stratification, susceptibility is homogeneous, contact is uniform, and infectious individuals transmit at a per-contact rate scaled by \( 1/N \).

### Product Models for Modular Stratification  

The framework above allows for arbitrary stratifications of the \( S \), \( E \), and \( I \) compartments. In practice, complex stratifications are often built by combining simpler ones — for example, stratifying by age, location, and symptom status simultaneously.  

We formalize this using **product models**, where the full stratification is represented as the Cartesian product of simpler factors (e.g., age groups \( \times \) locations \( \times \) symptom statuses). Each compartment corresponds to a unique combination of levels across these factors.  

For example, suppose we stratify by age (child, adult) and location (urban, rural). The susceptible vector \( S \) then has four entries:
$$
S = \begin{pmatrix} S_{\text{child, urban}} \\ S_{\text{child, rural}} \\ S_{\text{adult, urban}} \\ S_{\text{adult, rural}} \end{pmatrix}.
$$
Parameters like susceptibility or contact rates can vary by age alone, location alone, or both, depending on model design.  

Product models allow us to:  
- Define parameters that vary along specific dimensions,  
- Build large, structured transmission models from simpler components,  
- Control complexity by selectively including or collapsing stratification dimensions.  

The force of infection and flow allocation machinery developed above applies directly to these multi-dimensional strata.


### Example: Building a Transmission Matrix with Kronecker Products  

When stratifications are defined by a product of factors, transmission matrices can often be constructed as Kronecker products of simpler matrices associated with each factor.  

For example, suppose:  
- Contact patterns differ by **age** (with a \( 2 \times 2 \) contact matrix \( P_{\text{age}} \)),  
- Individuals interact equally across **locations** (represented by a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix of ones, \( 1_{2 \times 2} \)).  

The full contact matrix \( P \) for the combined age-location stratification (with 4 age-location groups) is given by the Kronecker product:
$$
P = P_{\text{age}} \otimes 1_{2 \times 2}.
$$
This expands \( P_{\text{age}} \) uniformly across locations, assuming location has no effect on contact rates.  

If location-specific effects were also important, we could replace \( 1_{2 \times 2} \) with a location contact matrix \( P_{\text{loc}} \), giving
$$
P = P_{\text{age}} \otimes P_{\text{loc}}.
$$

This approach lets us modularly build structured transmission matrices by combining simple factors — mirroring the way stratifications are built in the product model.

-----

#### Product Expansion  

The full susceptibility vector \( \sigma \), contact matrix \( P \), and infectivity vector \( \tau \) are given by **Kronecker products** of their factor-specific components:
$$
\sigma = \sigma^{(1)} \otimes \sigma^{(2)} \otimes \cdots \otimes \sigma^{(d)},
$$
$$
P = P^{(1)} \otimes P^{(2)} \otimes \cdots \otimes P^{(d)},
$$
$$
\tau = \tau^{(1)} \otimes \tau^{(2)} \otimes \cdots \otimes \tau^{(d)}.
$$

#### Transmission Matrix Construction  

The overall transmission matrix \( \beta \) is then constructed exactly as before:
$$
\beta = \operatorname{diag}(\sigma) \, P \, \operatorname{diag}(\tau).
$$

This formulation means that:
- Susceptibility effects,  
- Contact patterns, and  
- Infectivity effects  

are each **structured by Kronecker products reflecting the model’s stratification factors** — and then combined multiplicatively through this decomposition.  

---

This triple-Kronecker structure allows the transmission process to respect the modular stratification of the product model while retaining the familiar separation of susceptibility, contact, and infectivity.

## Decomposition of State-Dependent Rates

The vast majority of compartmental models contain flows that depend on the states of compartments that are not directly involved in those flows (i.e., the magnitude of the flow from compartment A to compartment B depends on another compartment, C). The most important example of these dependencies is infection, and so we use the terminology from infection processes. However, our model will subsume a very large number of flows as special cases.

Let \( S = (S_1, \ldots, S_n)^\top \), \( E = (E_1, \ldots, E_q)^\top \), and \( I = (I_1, \ldots, I_m)^\top \) denote the vectors of numbers of susceptible, exposed, and infectious individuals, respectively. Each element of these vectors corresponds to a specific stratum—such as an age group, location, symptom status, or immunity level—and the stratifications may differ between \( S \), \( E \), and \( I \). Consequently, \( n \), \( q \), and \( m \) may be different.

The force of infection vector, $\Lambda$, is $\beta I$, where beta is the transmission matrix (show the elements $\beta_ij$ out please).

The absolute rate of flow out of each of the $S$ states is $\Lambda \circ S$ (ethat's elementwise mult).  

Because $n$ and $q$ are not necessarily the same, the absolute rate of flow out of


We define the $n$-by-$m$ transmission matrix as the following decomposition.

$$
\DeclareMathOperator{\diag}{diag}
T = \diag(p) B \diag(c)
$$

This decomposition involves the following terms.

* $p$ -- length-$n$ vector of _susceptibilities_ for each $s$ state
* $B$ -- $n$-by-$m$ matrix of _contacts_ between each $x$ and $s$ state
* $c$ -- length-$m$ vector of _infectivities_ for each $x$ state

An alternative way to write the transmission matrix decomposition -- that I prefer because it is a more accurate representation of the actual computations -- is using [element-wise operations](https://canmod.github.io/macpan2/articles/elementwise_binary_operators.html). If $\circ$ is the element-wise product then we have the following.

$$
T = p \circ B \circ c^\top
$$

In this expression the column vector $p$ is element-wise multiplied by each column in $B$, and each row in this product is element-wise multiplied by the row vector $c^\top$, where $\top$ is the matrix transpose operator.

The vector containing the per-capita flow rates out of each of the $s$ states is the following.

$$
\lambda = Tx
$$

This $\lambda$ vector is often called the force of infection.

And finally the absolute flow rates out of each of the $s$ states is the following.

$$
\DeclareMathOperator{\diag}{diag}
r = \lambda \circ s
$$

## Example -- SIR

The $s$ vector contains a single state, `S`, and $x$ contains only `I`. In this case both $n$ and $m$ are 1, and so all components are 1-by-1 as follows.

* $p = 1$ -- susceptibility
* $B = 1$ -- contact matrix
* $c = \frac{\sigma}{N}$ -- infectivity

Therefore we have the following transmission matrix, per-capita flow rate vector, and absolute flow rate vector.

* $T = \frac{\sigma}{N}$
* $\lambda = \frac{\sigma}{N} I$
* $r = \frac{\sigma}{N} IS$

In this overly simple but hopefully clarifying example we could have decided to put $\sigma$ and $\frac{1}{N}$ in any of the components, $p$, $B$, or $c$. The point is that we have a somewhat mechanistic and somewhat general decomposition of transmission, so that when we start working with more complex models by combining model modules (e.g. combining SEIR with age and spatial structure) we have a way to conveniently combine these modules so that the resulting transmission rates make mechanistic sense.

## Product Models

Now we consider two models, each with the following triples representing the transmission decomposition.

$$
(p_1, B_1, c_1)
$$

$$
(p_2, B_2, c_2)
$$

Note that these subscripts represent the model, not the components of these vectors and matrices. The dimensions of the two models is $n_1, m_1$ and $n_2, m_2$.

Taking the product of these two models results in the following triple.

$$
(p, B, c) = (p_1\otimes p_2, B_1\otimes B_2, c_1\otimes c_2)
$$

Where $\otimes$ is the Kronecker product. This leads to an $n_1n_2$-by-1 column vector, $p$, $n_1n_2$-by-$m_1m_2$ matrix, $B$, and $m_1m_2$-by-1 column vector $c$.

We also have $x_1, x_2$ and $s_1, s_2$ to combine into $x$ and $s$. Before doing this we need to make a distinction between factor models with transmission and those without. For example, the SIR model clearly has transmission, but a factor model with just age groups does not. Because a pure age model does not distinguish between infectious and susceptible people, the only process that it considers is aging. Nevertheless when the age model becomes combined with a model that does have transmission, we want it to be ready for being combined.

To make an age model -- or any other factor model without transmission -- ready to be combined with a model that includes transmission we need to do two things. First we need to account for the fact that some or all states may appear in both $x$ and $s$ (e.g. young people can be both infectious and susceptible).  Second we need to include parameters that are not used in the factor model's processes but that will be used when it is combined with a model that includes transmission (e.g. an age model needs to have a contact matrix even though contact processes do not affect aging, which is the only process in the age model). The next example illustrates these ideas.

## Example -- SIR times age

We take the product of the SIR model above with a two-age-group factor model. The components of the transmission decomposition for this particular age-group factor model is as follows.

* susceptibility: $p = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$
* contact matrix: $B = \begin{bmatrix} q & (1 - q) \\ (1 - q) & q \end{bmatrix}$
* infectivity: $c = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_\text{young} \\ \sigma_\text{young} \end{bmatrix}$

Here $q$ is the probability that any given contact is between individuals of the same age. This is a symmetric contact matrix, but we didn't need to do that. We have also decided to not have susceptibility depend on age, but we absolutely could have by parameterizing that vector.

It is a little odd to refer to this as a decomposition of transmission, because the age-only model contains only aging processes and does not include transmission. However, including the transmission decomposition is necessary to prepare this model for combination with a model with transmission.

Taking the product of this age model with the SIR model above we have the following transmission decomposition.

* susceptibility: $p = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$
* contact matrix: $B = \begin{bmatrix} q & (1 - q) \\ (1 - q) & q \end{bmatrix}$
* infectivity: $c = \frac{\sigma}{N}\begin{bmatrix} \sigma_\text{young} \\ \sigma_\text{old} \end{bmatrix}$

In this product model $x$ contains `I.young` and `I.old` and $s$ contains `S.young` and `S.old`.

The transmission matrix can be obtained by multiplying the three components of the decomposition as follows.

$$
T = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} 
\circ \begin{bmatrix} q & (1 - q) \\ (1 - q) & q \end{bmatrix} 
\circ \frac{\sigma}{N}\begin{bmatrix} \sigma_\text{young} & \sigma_\text{old} \end{bmatrix}
= \frac{\sigma}{N} \begin{bmatrix} q \sigma_\text{young} & (1 - q) \sigma_\text{old} \\ (1 - q) \sigma_\text{young} & q \sigma_\text{old} \end{bmatrix}
$$

The force of infection vector is then the product of $T$ and $x = \begin{bmatrix}I_{\text{young}} \\ I_{\text{old}}\end{bmatrix}$

$$
\lambda = \frac{\sigma}{N} \begin{bmatrix} q \sigma_\text{young} I_{\text{young}} + (1-q) \sigma_\text{old} I_{\text{old}} \\ (1-q) \sigma_\text{young} I_{\text{young}} + q \sigma_\text{old} I_{\text{old}} \end{bmatrix}
$$

## Example -- SIR with multiple I-boxes times age

This example SIR model has $n = 1$ susceptible class and $m = 2$ infectious classes -- mild and severe -- with the following transmission decomposition.

* susceptibility: $p = 1$
* contact matrix: $B = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$
* infectivity: $c = \frac{1}{N}\begin{bmatrix} \sigma_\text{mild} \\ \sigma_\text{severe} \end{bmatrix}$

Multiplying this decomposition by the age model above (in that order) gives the following model with $n = 2$ susceptible compartments and $m = 4$ infectious compartments.

* susceptibility: $p = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$
* contact matrix: $B = \begin{bmatrix} q & (1 - q) & q & (1 - q) \\ (1 - q) & q & (1 - q) & q \end{bmatrix}$
* infectivity: $c = \frac{1}{N}\begin{bmatrix} \sigma_\text{mild} \sigma_\text{young} \\ \sigma_\text{mild} \sigma_\text{old}\\ \sigma_\text{severe} \sigma_\text{young}\\ \sigma_\text{severe}\sigma_\text{old} \end{bmatrix}$

The non-square contact matrix might seem weird, but it is fine because it is modelling contacts between the two susceptible classes with the four infectious classes.

One could write out the $2$-by-$4$ transmission matrix, but I don't think it would be too informative. What would be more informative would be to write out a component of the force of infection vector, say for young people. 

$$
\begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
\lambda_{\text{young}} = \frac{1}{N} 
& ( & & q      \sigma_\text{mild}    \sigma_\text{young}  I_{\text{mild},\text{young}} \\
& & + & (1-q)  \sigma_\text{mild}    \sigma_\text{old}    I_{\text{mild},\text{old}} \\
& & + & q      \sigma_\text{severe}  \sigma_\text{young}  I_{\text{severe},\text{young}} \\
& & + & (1-q)  \sigma_\text{severe}  \sigma_\text{old}    I_{\text{severe},\text{old}} & ) \\
\end{array}
$$

The first term, for example, gives the contribution to the force of infection due to contacts between young susceptible individuals and mildly infected young individuals.

## Example -- SIR with multiple I-boxes and partial immunity times age

We are starting to approach 'real' models now. This SIR model has an R box that can now flow back into I, because the immunity gained through infection and recovery is imperfect. This model feature means that the $s$ vector has two states, `S` and `R`, and so $n = 2$. The $x$ vector contains `I_mild` and `I_severe`, and so $m = 2$ as well. The transmission decomposition looks like this.

* susceptibility: $p = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 - \pi \end{bmatrix}$
* contact matrix: $B = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$
* infectivity: $c = \frac{1}{N}\begin{bmatrix} \sigma_\text{mild} \\ \sigma_\text{severe} \end{bmatrix}$

Here $\pi$ is the efficacy of immunity against reinfection.

The product of this model with age looks like this.

* susceptibility: $p = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1- \pi \\ 1-\pi \end{bmatrix}$
* contact matrix: $B = \begin{bmatrix} q & (1 - q) & q & (1 - q) \\ (1 - q) & q & (1 - q) & q  \\ q & (1 - q) & q & (1 - q) \\ (1 - q) & q & (1 - q) & q \end{bmatrix}$
* infectivity: $c = \frac{1}{N}\begin{bmatrix} \sigma_\text{mild} \sigma_\text{young} \\ \sigma_\text{mild} \sigma_\text{old}\\ \sigma_\text{severe} \sigma_\text{young}\\ \sigma_\text{severe}\sigma_\text{old} \end{bmatrix}$

The force of infection for young individuals in the R box, for example, is given by the following expression

$$
\begin{array}{rrrrrr}
\lambda_{\text{R,young}} = \frac{1-\pi}{N}
& ( & & q      \sigma_\text{mild}    \sigma_\text{young}  I_{\text{mild},\text{young}} \\
& & + & (1-q)  \sigma_\text{mild}    \sigma_\text{old}    I_{\text{mild},\text{old}} \\
& & + & q      \sigma_\text{severe}  \sigma_\text{young}  I_{\text{severe},\text{young}} \\
& & + & (1-q)  \sigma_\text{severe}  \sigma_\text{old}    I_{\text{severe},\text{old}} & ) \\
\end{array}
$$

Note that this is almost identical to the expression for $\lambda_\text{young}$ above, but with a factor, $1-\pi$, giving the reduction in transmission conferred by immunity.

$$
\lambda_{\text{R,young}} = (1-\pi) \lambda_{\text{young}}
$$

## Example

Assume we have an SI model times a young-old model.

`Variables.csv`
```
Epi,        Age
S,          young
I,          young
S,          old
I,          old
susceptibility,  
contact
```



## Bookkeeping (in progress)

Index each element of $s$ with $i$ and each element of $x$ with $j$.

We can define the per-capita rate at which individuals flow out of the $s_i$ compartment with the following decomposition.

$$
r_i = p_i \lambda_i
$$

The components of the decomposition are as follows.

* $p_i$: susceptibility (e.g. complement of vaccine efficacy)
* $\lambda_i$: force of infection

With this definition, the absolute rate of flow out of $s_i$ is given by $r_i s_i$.

The force of infection is.

$$
\lambda_i = \sum_j B_{ij}c_jx_j
$$
